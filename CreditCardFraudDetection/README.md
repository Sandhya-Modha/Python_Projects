# **Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions. Instead of traditional machine learning models, it leverages **statistical methods, rule-based techniques, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns in fraudulent activity.  

## **Key Features**  
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing transaction data  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying fraud patterns using statistical insights  
- ⚠️ **Anomaly Detection** – Using rule-based methods instead of ML models  
- 📈 **Visualizations** – Fraud trends and transaction distributions  

## **Technologies Used**  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** for data handling  
- 📉 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  

## **Files Included**  
- `Creditcard_fraud_detection_project.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with fraud detection analysis  

## **Conclusion**  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using **data-driven insights rather than machine learning models**. It highlights key fraud indicators that could be further explored with advanced methods.

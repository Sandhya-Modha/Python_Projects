# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍  

## Overview  
This project analyzes credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities. Instead of traditional machine learning classification models, it explores alternative techniques like **Passive Aggressive Regressor** for anomaly detection.  

## Key Features  
- 🏷️ Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- 📊 Fraud pattern visualization and insights  
- ⚡ Applying **Passive Aggressive Regressor** for anomaly detection  

## Technologies Used  
- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- 🏆 Scikit-learn (Passive Aggressive Regressor)  

## Files Included  
- `Creditcard_fraud_detection_project.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with analysis and implementation  
- `creditcard.csv` → Dataset containing transaction details  

## Future Scope  
- Experimenting with traditional ML models for classification  
- Improving fraud detection with deep learning techniques
